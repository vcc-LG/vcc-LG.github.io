For my birthday this year Hannah got me a Pi night vision camera:

As well as a camera suitable for use in the day. I already had a Pi Zero W, but Hannah got me a second one so that I didn't have to keep switching the cameras around.

I live in a rural-ish area of South Wales, and I've seen a hedgehog once and a fox once. I want to try and get some good footage of the wildlife that we live amongst.

I already had an inexpensive portable phone charger and wasn't sure how it would fare not only in providing sufficient power to the Pi and camera, but also whether it would give enough charge to make it through the night:

There are quite a range of software choices which turn the Pi into a motion detecting camera. For the night vision camera I chose motionEyeOS, which is hosted here:
